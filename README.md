Bash script for copying mpd (music player daemon) playlists

This script takes an mpd playlist file and copies the tracks contained in it to another location.
I use this so that i can create a playlist using an mpd client and then copy it onto my mp3 player.
It adds a counter to the filenames to preserve the order of tracks as they were in the playlist.



usage: copyplaylist playlist destination_path
